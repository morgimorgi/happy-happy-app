## dependencies!!!💟
i am not a pro, i just code this for my gf, so please excuse..

### you need node.js and the npm stuff! but i think this is standard..
you can do node/npm -v to make sure you have it

### you also need electron!!
```bash 
npm i electron
```

to run the app
```bash
npx electronmon .
```
for constant refresh!
if no refresh,
```bash 
npm run start
```
i think

if my girlfriend is reading this:
HELLO! i love you and i hope you like my FIRST solo project!!!! you taught me how to get here :3 💞
keep doing what you are doing! you are doing amazing!!!! happy birthday sweet pea 🍨🎆
