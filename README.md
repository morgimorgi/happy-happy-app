## dependencies!!!
i am not a pro, i just code this for my gf, so please excuse..

# you need node.js and the npm stuff! but i think this is standard..
you can do node/npm -v to make sure you have it

# you also need electron!!
npm i electron

to run the app
npx electronmon .
for constant refresh!
if no refresh,
npm run start
i think
